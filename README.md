# Project Silverplate

A configurator app for devices running the [Qubit](https://github.com/cloudgazing/qubit) firmware.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still **work in progress**, and **most features do not work**.

## TODO:

- write the HID connection functionality.
- write the protocol for communicating with qubit devices (this is currently dependent on Qubit defining an interface, which it currently doesn't)
- write the Metal interactive view.
- other stuff
- give this project a proper name
